## **How to Contribute**

1. **Fork the repository**:

2. **Clone your fork**:

   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

     git clone https://github.com/m-mdy-m/NExa.git
     ```

3. **Create a new branch**:

   - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. This will keep your work isolated from the main branch.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-name
     ```

4. **Make your changes**:

   - Make the necessary changes to the codebase.
   - Test your changes thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected.

5. **Commit your changes**:

   - Use semantic commits when committing your changes. This helps maintain clarity and consistency across the project.

   ### **Semantic Commit Messages**:

   - **`feat:`**: A new feature for the user.
     - Example: `feat: add daily scheduling feature for NExa`
   - **`fix:`**: A bug fix.
     - Example: `fix: resolve issue with API rate limiting`
   - **`docs:`**: Documentation changes or additions.
     - Example: `docs: update README with installation instructions`
   - **`style:`**: Changes that don’t affect the meaning of the code (e.g., formatting, whitespace).
     - Example: `style: format code to match PEP8 guidelines`
   - **`refactor:`**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature but improve code quality.
     - Example: `refactor: simplify scraper logic`
